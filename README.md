# phasmo-chat

phasmo-chat is a generative AI project with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that answers questions about the game [Phasmophobia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/) by 
Kinetic Games.

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with Kinetic Games, the creators of Phasmophobia. The information provided by phasmo-chat is sourced from [Phasmophobia Wiki](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page).

## Purpose

This is a personal project created for learning purposes. It aims to help me hone my skills in generative AI and RAG. I intend to explore and experiment with various AI technologies and techniques through this project.

## Features

- Answer questions about Phasmophobia using Large Language Model (LLM).
- Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for more accurate and context-aware responses.

## Backend Technologies

The backend of this project (API) is built using the following technologies:

- **[LangChain](https://langchain.com)**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com)**: Used for generating responses.
- **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs.
- **[ChromaDB](https://chromadb.com)**: A database for managing and querying embeddings.
- **[Cohere](https://cohere.ai)**: Used for language understanding and generation.
